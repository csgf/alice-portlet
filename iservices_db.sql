It was designed to explore the physics predicted by the Standard Model and to search for physics beyond it. ALEPH first measured events in LEP in July 1989. LEP operated at around 91 GeV â€“ the predicted optimum energy for the formation of the Z particle. From 1995 to 2000 the accelerator operated at energies up to 200 GeV, above the threshold for producing pairs of W particles. The data taken, consisted of millions of events recorded by the ALEPH detector,allowed precision tests of the electro-weak Standard Model (SM) to be undertaken. The group here concentrated our analysis efforts mainly in Heavy Flavour (beauty and charm) physics, in searches for the the Higgs boson, the particles postulated to generate particle mass, and for physics beyond the SM, e.g. Supersymmetry, and in W physics.

This application perform the search for the production and non-standard decay of a scalar Higgs boson into four tau leptons through the intermediation of the neutral pseudo-scalars Higgs particle. 

The analysis was conducted by the ALEPH collaboration with the data collected at centre-of-mass energies from 183 to 209 GeV.');

-- access to services
-- Any service has its own access methods such as: 'ssh, vnc, rdp, etc'
-- Each method requires a different kind of credentials that are included into a ; separated string inside  acc_info
-- These settings contain generic information that could be customized duing service allocation (see allocated_access)
